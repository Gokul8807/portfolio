      <h1>Hi, I'm Gokul</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring <b>Web Developer</b> and <b>Data Analyst</b>. My portfolio highlights not only my technical journey but also my vision to build websites that inspire, educate, and empower users. I believe websites should be more than digital placeholders; they must be living experiences that tell stories, guide people, and make tasks easier. My background in engineering, combined with my self‑learning in coding, allows me to approach development with both precision and creativity.</p>

      <h3>Why Web Development?</h3>
      <p>Web development is my chosen path because it blends logic with creativity. I enjoy solving technical challenges while also shaping the visual identity of projects. Writing HTML and CSS feels like sculpting structure and style, while data integration connects design with real‑world insights. For me, web development is the art of making information accessible and engaging.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Front‑End Focus</h3>
      <p>I specialize in front‑end development, which involves creating responsive layouts, intuitive navigation, and interactive components. I continuously practice advanced CSS effects, transitions, and hover animations to make user interactions smooth and satisfying. A well‑implemented front‑end builds the bridge between raw functionality and human‑centered design.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>User Experience</h3>
      <p>Every website is an experience. I pay attention to typography, spacing, and color balance to ensure clarity and comfort for readers. By testing layouts across devices, I guarantee accessibility. Good UX is invisible—it doesn’t distract the user but helps them achieve their goals seamlessly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>One of my key projects is the symposium website for my department. Through it, I learned the importance of structure, consistent color palettes, and mobile optimization. I also experimented with reusable components, which taught me efficiency. Each project adds layers to my skills, preparing me for professional web development work.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>My Web Development Journey</h3>
      <p>My journey started with curiosity about how websites function. Initially, I experimented with static pages, editing colors, fonts, and layouts. This phase was exciting because small changes brought visible results. Over time, I explored responsive design principles, learning how to make layouts adapt to different screens. I discovered the importance of media queries and fluid units. These basics formed my foundation.</p>
      <p>Later, I focused on adding life to pages using CSS hover effects and transitions. These subtle animations made the pages interactive and engaging. The deeper I went, the more I realized the power of design in shaping user perception. During my symposium project, I applied these skills to build a real product. It was a milestone that gave me confidence to take on larger challenges.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am expanding my skills by practicing advanced styling, improving my understanding of color psychology, and structuring layouts with readability in mind. I dedicate time to analyzing professional websites to learn best practices. My long‑term goal is to become a versatile developer capable of delivering both visually pleasing and functionally sound applications.</p>
